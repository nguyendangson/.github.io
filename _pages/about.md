I am a Ph.D. graduated in May 2024 in Mathematics at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa. I also earned a Master's degree in Optimization and Statistics at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan in 2018.

I am interested in both Math and Computer Science. My research interests include high-dimension Optimization,Probability,Statistics problems and their applications involving Geometry, Graph theory and Random Algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, Matrix Scaling, Sampling on Convex Bodies, Hight-dimension Convex Geometry,... I prefer transforming real-business problems into mathematical problems, then using Python, R or Matlab to solve by computing, finding patterns, and designing algorithms. 

From Oct 2023-May 2024, I was a Data Science Intern in Management Reporting and Business Intelligence team at Volvo Trucks , Greensboro, North Carolina, US. 

Currently, I am looking for jobs: Data Science, Statistician, Operation Research, Supply Chain, Machine Learning Engineering, Quantitative Analysis/Research, and Computational Science
